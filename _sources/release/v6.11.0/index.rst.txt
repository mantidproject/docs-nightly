We are proud to announce version 6.11.0 of Mantid.

In this release we gave extra attention to fixing bugs and improving algorithms (for example by making them run faster or use less memory).
We also added several new algorithms. These are the highlights for this release:

- For single crystal diffraction, we added a new algorithm :ref:`FindMultipleUMatrices <algm-FindMultipleUMatrices>`
  to find multiple UB matrices when given lattice parameters for sample with multiple domains or spurious peaks.
- Also for single crystal diffraction,  :ref:`IntegratePeaksSkew <algm-IntegratePeaksSkew>` is better at determining background bins by minimising third-moment (skew).
  This is achieved by forcing skew > 0 (minimum skew we would expect in background).
  This change stops peak mask of :ref:`IntegratePeaksSkew <algm-IntegratePeaksSkew>` including too many pixels due to small diffuse scattering (seen in the figure above).
- For powder diffraction, the algorithms
  :ref:`AlignAndFocusPowder <algm-AlignAndFocusPowder>`,
  :ref:`AlignAndFocusPowderFromFiles <algm-AlignAndFocusPowderFromFiles>`,
  :ref:`SNSPowderReduction <algm-SNSPowderReduction>` and
  :ref:`LoadEventAndCompress <algm-LoadEventAndCompress>`
  were updated to use logarithmic compression, which uses less memory.
- For reflectometry, we added a new algorithm :ref:`algm-PolarizationEfficienciesWildes` has been added for calculating the efficiencies of the polarizing components of an instrument with two flippers.
  This algorithm implements the approach from the A. R. Wildes 2006 paper.
- For SANS, we added new algorithm :ref:`PolarizerEfficiency <algm-PolarizerEfficiency-v1>` for calculating the efficiency of a polariser.

- Mantid developer environments are now created using a new ``mantid-developer`` Conda meta-package, hosted on our Conda channel.

These are just some of the many improvements in this release, so please take a
look at the release notes, which are filled with details of the
important changes and improvements in many areas. The development team
has put a great effort into making all of these improvements within
Mantid, and we would like to thank all of our beta testers for their
time and effort helping us to make this another reliable version of Mantid.

Throughout the Mantid project we put a lot of effort into ensuring
Mantid is a robust and reliable product. Thank you to everyone that has
reported any issues to us. Please keep on reporting any problems you
have, or crashes that occur on our `forum`_.

Installation packages can be found on our `download page`_
which now links to the assets on our `GitHub release page`_, where you can also
access the source code for the release.
